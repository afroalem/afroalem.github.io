                <p>Hello, my name is Alem Tesfay, and I'm hoping to get re-elected to the student council this year. Since the school setting has normalized, I believe it's important to get students more involved with everything our campus has to offer.I'm currently in my third academic year at Macewan, majoring in management with a double minor in marketing and political science. Being a part of various extracurricular activities has positively affected the way I approach my academics. I believe if you only go to school to obtain a certificate, you aren’t getting your money's worth. The skills and networking opportunities you can gain from being a part of things like student groups, the ambassador program, or simply joining committees is priceless. If I get re-elected to the student council, I will continue to work hard to advocate for student engagement. Thank you for your consideration and support!</p>
